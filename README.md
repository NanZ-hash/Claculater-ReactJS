# Calculator Project.
**Note: this project is an implementation of a Youtube mini project for a ReactJs Calculator project.**



I started this small project to refresh my programing skills with react JS, and I like to see it where can I extend it.
for a start : 
- The calculator will do simple function of { + , - , / , * }.
- The user can press a button.

Futer Goal:
1. This calculator will cal will have more advanced functions,
for example, it will calculate with multiple operations.
